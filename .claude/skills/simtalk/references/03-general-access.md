## General Access to SimTalk - Introduction

### General Access to SimTalk
    The programming language SimTalk extends the ways you can
        model and control your simulation. Each object has built-in properties providing many useful
        features. 
            If your model requires more detailed or completely different
                properties, you will program these in the programming language SimTalk. You can also combine the Method object
                with the built-in objects to create models of great complexity.
            First, you will type the statements, which the built-in Interpreter executes, into an instance of the object Method
                . Then
                press the F7 and F5 keys to execute your source code. 
            When you then run the simulation, the Interpreter executes the source code, which you typed into your Method line-by-line and takes the actions you
                programmed.
            Note 
                SimTalk normally does not distinguish
                    between upper- and lower-casing for the names of methods, attributes and read-only attributes which you type into the source code of your Method objects.
            
            SimTalk 2.0 makes programming methods in Plant
                    Simulation faster, easier, and less error-prone than SimTalk
                    1.0. New simulation models use the SimTalk 2.0
                    notation by default! 
            You can change between SimTalk
                    1.0 and SimTalk 2.0 by
                clicking New Syntax [command]
                 on the
                    Tools ribbon tab of the Method you are programming. If you want to use SimTalk 2.0 syntax for all new Methods which you are going to program, activate New Syntax in the Method
                    class in the Class Library. Changes caused by
                    SimTalk 2.0 also affect how the window
                    Show Attributes and
                    Methods shows the signature of methods, attributes and read-only
                    attributes.
            Note 
                You can select if you want to use the SimTalk 2.0 notation
                    or the SimTalk 1.0 notation for each and every one of
                    your Methods. You can also freely mix SimTalk 2.0
                        notation and SimTalk 1.0 notation in your
                    simulation models. There is no need to reprogram your existing source code.
            
            Note 
                Clicking  in an existing
                        Method, which you programmed in SimTalk 1.0
                        notation, automatically converts the source code to the correct
                        SimTalk 2.0 notation. 
            
            Note 
                To convert the source code of all existing Methods in a simulation model to the new syntax, hold down Shift, click the object Basis in the Class
                        Library with the right mouse button and click Convert all Methods to New Syntax.

### Why Use SimTalk 2.0?
SimTalk 2.0 encompasses:

A line-controlled syntax
You do not have to type a semicolon ; at the
end of each statement. Instead, you can type a single statement into a line. As you might want to be
able to split a statement and distribute it over several lines, the interpreter automatically
determines if the statement is still incomplete and, if this is the case, continues it in the next
line. You can type a semicolon after a statement to add another statement to the same line
though.
| SimTalk 2.0 | SimTalk 1.0 || CopyMyStation.setName("MyStation") | CopyMyStation.setName("MyStation"); |

A simplified body syntax
In SimTalk 1.0 the source code requires the keywords
is do end. SimTalk 2.0 does not need
these keywords. 
In SimTalk 2.0 you declare parameters with the keyword param, local variables with the keyword var, and the return value of a method with the
keyword -> (hyphen plus right angle bracket).
| SimTalk 2.0 | SimTalk 1.0 || CopyMyStation.setName("MyStation") | Copyis
do
   MyStation.setName("MyStation");
end |

Improved referencing of methods and global
variables
In SimTalk 1.0 Methods and Variables are referenced with the reference operator ref. 
In SimTalk 2.0 you reference Methods and Variables with a leading &
operator, for example 
```
var o:object := &Method
```
.

New div/mod operator: In SimTalk 1.0 the // operator represents
an integer division and the \\ operator represents an integer
modulo operation. 
In SimTalk 2.0 the keyword div represents an integer division and the
keyword mod represents an integer
modulo operation.

Improved string literals
In SimTalk 2.0 a backslash (\) inside a string only protects
double quotation marks and line breaks, it does not protect another backslash as it did in SimTalk 1.0. 
"A string literal is a sequence of characters from the
source character set enclosed in double quotation marks (
`""`
). To
represent a double quotation mark in a string literal, use the escape sequence 
`\"`
. The backslash 
`\`
 must be followed with
a second backslash 
`\\`
 when it appears within a string." Microsoft
Learn

Time literals
A time literal starts with a digit and must contain one
or more colons. A time literal can contain a decimal point and decimal
places.
```
wait 1:30                    // wait for 1 minute and 30 seconds
&Methode.methCall(1:0:0:0.5) // call the method in 1 day and half a second
```

Default arguments
Define default arguments for formal parameters by typing an assignment operator
and the default value after the parameter declaration, for example: 
```
param x
:= 0
```
.

Simplified control flow statements
The control structures which you can insert with the command Insert Control Structure into your source code,
reflect the simplified control structures. 

You can type control flow statements using the simplified syntax:

if-end instead of
if-then-end

for-next instead of
for-loop-next

switch-case-end instead
of inspect-when-then-end

while-end instead of
while-loop-end

The keyword then in
if-statements is optionally allowed.

The keyword loop in
loops is optionally allowed.

We added the keyword continue, which skips the rest of the loop iteration, and continues with the next iteration.
If the iteration was the last iteration, continue exits the
loop.

A changed about equal operator

You now have to use:

`~=`
 instead of 
`==`
, compare Tolerance for about equal
(~=) comparison.

`<~=`
 instead of 
`<==`

`>~=`
 instead of 
`>==`

New operators for adding, subtracting, or
multiplying a value

`x += y`
 is short for 
```
x
:= x + y
```

`x -= y`
 is short for 
```
x
:= x - y
```

`x *= y`
 is short for 
```
x
:= x * y
```

An improved list and table syntax
You now only type list ranges using braces 
```
{}
```
.
The optional 1.0 syntax using a grave accent 
```
`[]
```
 is no longer
available.

Read an element of a one-dimensional
list with the bracket operator

```
[]
```
. This works for StackFile and QueueFile as well. You can read and remove an element from a DataList with the built-in method remove.
Note 
When reading the contents of a cell of a DataList with
the bracket operator

```
[]
```
 in SimTalk 1.0, this reads and removes the contents of
the designated cell. The remaining cells move up by one position.
When assigning a value to the designated cell with the bracket operator to a DataList in SimTalk 1.0, this value is inserted into the cell and the existing cells moves
down by one position. 

Note 
When reading the contents of a cell with the bracket
operator

```
[]
```
 in SimTalk 2.0, the contents of the designated cell
will be read, but will remain in the DataStack, DataQueue, and the DataList. 
When assigning a value to the designated cell with the bracket operator to a DataList in SimTalk 2.0, this value will just overwrite the contents of the existing cell.
This way a DataList will behave the same way as a DataTable with one column.

### Introducing SimTalk
SimTalk consists of the built-in methods,
read-only attributes, and attributes and of control
structures. SimTalk
encompasses:

The built-in methods, read-only
attributes, and attributes which the Plant
Simulation objects provide. These are defined by our software engineers and offer a base you
can build on. 

Control structures and language constructs. With loops and conditional branching
you can control the sequence of method execution. 

We use this notation when describing the syntax of a method: 

The expression Path is the path of the object. 

The signature of the method, consisting of the identifier and the data type of
the parameter, is listed in parentheses. The expression (Parameter:string),
for example, designates a parameter of data type string. Instead of a
constant value, you can also use a variable of the required type or a method that returns the required data type. 
Note 
Make sure to enter the parentheses for expressions within parentheses (…). Not
entering them may lead to unexpected results and open the Debugger.

Optional parameters are listed within brackets. The expression [,Parameter:boolean], for example, means that you can, but do not have to enter
the boolean parameter. 
If a parameter has a default value, the signature shows the default value after
the parameter.
If the method has a return value, the signature shows
its data type after the arrow ->.

The window Show Attributes
and Methods shows all methods, read-only
attributes, and attributes of the selected object. 

Select Show Attributes and Methods on the
context menu of the Class Library to show the attributes and methods of the selected Class. 

Press the F8 key or click Show Attributes and Methods on the Home ribbon tab of the Frame into which you inserted an
instance to show the attributes and methods of the
selected Instance. The figure below
illustrates the information using the example of the object Station. 

In the Plant Simulation Help we use these
conventions:

Within descriptions in the body text on the topic pages the names of objects
begin with an upper-case letter and are italicized, for example ParallelStation, Station, etc. 
In the Plant Simulation Help, the colored term sometimes
is a link to an object, for example ParallelStation. Click the link to open that topic in the Online
Help.

In the description in the Plant Simulation Help the
names of methods begin with a lower-case letter. Each new term after that
begins with an upper-case letter. Methods are italicized, for example derive, updateDialog, etc. 
In the Online Help, the colored term sometimes is a link
to a method, for example derive. Click the link to open that topic in the Online Help

In the description in the Online Help the names of attributes and read-only attributes begin with an
upper-case letter. Each new term after that begins with an upper-case letter as well. Attributes and read-only attributes are italicized,
for example CreationTableActive, ReferenceTime,
etc. 
In the Online Help, the colored term sometimes is a link
to an attribute, for example CreationTableActive. Click the link to open that topic in the Online
Help.

In the description in the Online Help we use MU and part interchangeably, for example the processed
MU and the processed part mean the same. If Part start with an upper-case P though, it refers to the MU of type Part. 

Note 
These spelling conventions apply to the Online Help.

Note 
SimTalk normally does not distinguish between upper-
and lower-casing for the names of methods, attributes, and read-only attributes, which you type into the source
code of your Method objects. You do not have
to use the spelling which the window Show Attributes and
Methods shows. You can, for example, type in 
`CreationTableActive`
, 
`creationtableactive`
, or 
`CREATIONTABLEACTIVE`
.
Note 
SimTalk supports English and German for programming the source
code of your methods.
For this reason the German Help shows
the English name of the attribute,
read-only attribute, and method next to the
German name, separated by a forward slash, for example
EnergieAktiv [SimTalk] / EnergyActive. This facilitates
programming methods if you are working with the German
version of Plant Simulation and are creating an English language model that your colleagues in other countries can use
as well.

### SimTalk Attributes, Read-only Attributes, Methods, and Functions
    
    SimTalk provides attributes, methods, read-only attributes, and functions.
        The
                description of the individual attributes, methods, read-only attributes, and
                    functions shows this under the section title Type.The window Show Attributes and
                    Methods shows most types a well.
        Attributes in SimTalk
            
            An attribute in SimTalk sets or gets a property of an object. 
            Attributes encompass the built-in attributes
                of the object, user-defined attributes, local variables, and objects of type Variable.
            An attribute in SimTalk looks like
                this:
```
EventController.AbsTimeFormat := true
```

```
print EventController.AbsTimeFormat // returns true
```

        
        Methods in SimTalk
            
            A method in SimTalk
                is a block of source code that executes a task when called. 
            Methods as a rule have parameters, have side
                effects, and can return a value.
            A method in SimTalk
            
            
                
                    gets information from an object and returns a value
                
                
                    computes a value
                
                
                    starts one or several actions that control the behavior of the object
                
            
            A method in SimTalk looks like
                this:
```
TableVariable := EventController.getEventList(-1)
```

```
MyStation.addObserver("occupied", &myMethod)
```

        
        Read-only Attributes in SimTalk
            
            A read-only attribute in SimTalk returns a value of a property of an object. 
            Read-only attributes do not expect
                parameters, do not have side effects, and return a value.
            A read-only attribute in SimTalk
                looks like this:
```
param sensorID: integer, Front: boolean
if @.ID = 1 
   @.Speed := 0
   print EventController.SimTime, " The first Transporter stopped."
end)
```

        
        Functions in SimTalk
            
            A function in SimTalk is a piece of source code that applies in general and is not
                object-specific. 
            A  function in SimTalk looks like this:
```
if currentEventCtl /= VOID
   print "simulation running in frame", currentEventCtl.location
   print "simulation running in frame", root
end)
```
